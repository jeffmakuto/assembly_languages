## Introduction

This repository allows me learn various assembly languages in my plight to be a malware analyst/researcher and reverse engineer. I'll look at 3 different assembly languages and practice with several tasks, programs and projects for each language I use.

## Assembly Languages

1. x86
2. ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)
3. MIPS (Million Instructions Per Seconds)
